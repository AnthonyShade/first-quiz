# first-quiz
I'm not going to sugar coat it, this was probably the toughest challenge so far, I had to scrap and rework so much stuff, but it is on me for putting it off so long. This is a quiz that will test you on certain javascript/api things, the questions copied from the example. I was not able to get the score to log into the local storage, but I plan to come back to this assignment and fix that at some point, as I think I nearly had it figured out, but just couldnt get the finer details to work. On a higher note, most of the html building and css styling and *some* of the javascript I found to be quite a lot easier than in past weeks, which I hope means it's becoming easier to keep track of things and use them. I ended up sniping a few things from other example quizes because of things I couldn't get to work, like the way to change CSS styles through Javascript, the "getcomputedcode" ended up giving me a very big headache error that could not get fixed no matter what tutorial I read through. Overall I think this challenge definitely pushed my boundaries and while this defintely wasn't my favorite week of class, I have a better grasp on it than I did during the original week.
